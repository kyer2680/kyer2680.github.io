    <h4>How does the brain take in information?</h4>
    <p>New information passes through the sensory to your immediate memory. It is called immediate memory because it is not permanent. This is why when you learn something in class you may remember it the period after that class but not when you get home from school. The question is, how do you make yourself remember what you learned for longer than 90 minutes.</p>
