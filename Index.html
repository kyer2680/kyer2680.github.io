    <li>Stress Management is important for everyone, but especially in teenagers. During the years of being a teenager there are a lot of stressors including: school, social issues, internal conflicts, and a handful of other things. I hope this toolkit of skills to assist in not just relieving stress, but learning how to handle it in a mature manner will help teenagers not just for their teen years but for the rest of their lives. Learning how to handle stress is a life skill that everyone should have to better themselves and remain healthy physically, emotionally, and mentally.
